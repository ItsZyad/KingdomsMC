Alpha 0.4.1 :: 07-OCT-2023 -> 23-FEB-2024;
__________________________________________
    BUG FIXES / PERFORMANCE:
    - Removed dozens of obsolete scripts that were eating up memory on startup.
    - Updated callout formats and standardized them.
    - Made the /k and /ks command processors MUCH faster.
    - Made the Kingdoms-Dynmap bridge much more efficient.
    - Fixed ඞ. You will now ඞ correctly.

    LARGE ADDITIONS:
    - [Technical] Created a standard library which packages all basic functionality into smaller functions called the Kingdoms Application Programming Interface (KAPI). This should help with code standardization, make modding possible, and help cut down on trivial errors in the future.
    - Implemented the Kingdoms Package Manager (KPM). This allows for the complete modularization of the Kingdoms codebase. KPM will be instrumental to modding for Kingdoms by allowing developers to segement code into different pacakges/addons and hot-swapping them while the server is running.

Alpha 0.4.2 :: 23-FEB-2024 -> 30-APR-2024;
__________________________________________
    BUG FIXES / PERFORMANCE:
    - Fixed bug which reactivated sidebar whenever it updated even if the player had it set to hidden.
    - Fixed a rare issue with paginated interfaces which caused normally unstackable items to stack.
    - Improved startup time by reducing console debugs and read/write calls on server start.
    - Improved the way that Kingdoms handles player input and generates its custom chat messages. A marked improvement to chat performance was recorded.

    SMALL ADDITIONS:
    - [Technical] Fully modernized the flag visualizer, a very important dev tool which potential future modders will rely heavily on, by increasing performance by up to 20ms in some instances and cleaning up its interface.
    - Fleshed out KAPI and divided into numerous 'namespaces' depending on which part of the codebases it interfaces with (armies, economy, KPM, etc.)
    - Added basic visual interface to KPM. This allows you to load, unload, and read addon information without having to use commands.

    LARGE ADDITION:
    - Added prestige degredation; prestige will decay over time in kingdoms which have a lower prestige level than the average of all other kingdoms.
    - Retired '/k castleclaim' and '/k coreclaim' commands in favor of a unified '/k claim' command. (I also took this opportunity to slightly improve the performance of the claiming code).
    - Introduced environment-variable crop growth. Different factors such as biome humidity, temperature, overall climate, and altitude will affect crop growth rates, forcing more specialization between kingdoms.

Alpha 0.4.3 :: 15-MAY-2024 -> 01-AUG-2024;
__________________________________________
    BUG FIXES / PERFORMANCE:
    - [Technical] All Kingdoms builds from now on will target 1.20.x
    - [Technical] Added null checks to all API code. Should lead to fewer instances where you get random jumbles of code or null values on errors.
    - [Technical] Began removing a lot of the 4-kingdom hard-coding that's been present since Alpha 0.2.0. It should be a lot easier to add and remove kingdoms on the fly now.
    - Fixed *A LOT* of longstanding issues with the markets such as weird null values that break entire systems, whole simulation ticks that don't go through, and general weirdness with merchant interfaces.
        * This likely isn't the last we'll see of markets-related bugs, but there should still be a vast difference between this and Alpha 0.4.0p4.
    - Fixed a small bug which blocked players from chatting after using the outpost claiming command.
    - Fixed bug which prevented the player from giving squad orders after renaming it in certain instances.
    - Fixed a never seen bug which could cause players seeking to switch kingdoms to change sidebars while still remaining in the same kingdom technically.
    - Temporary data attached to the player now gets auto-wiped whenever the player leaves the server as a precaution to prevent bugs caused by inconsistent player states and de-syncs.
    - Fixed bug which caused the chunkmap to spit out a bunch of code garble under some exceptional circumstances.
    - Fixed an almost comical amount of bugs with the outpost manager (It was a wonder that it ever worked at all).
        * I'm just gonna leave the commit link here to show how absurdly error-ridden this module was: (https://github.com/ItsZyad/KingdomsMC/commit/2fcb375fb8dc40249871a50bf05ec10ca034dbbc) (this was live code for 3 FUCKING YEARS).
    - Fixed a bug where squad managers were not capable of calculating the number of beds in their AOE until someone broke or placed down a bed.
    - Fixed a bug which caused squad manager upkeeps to be calculated as zero all the time.
    - Players will now no longer be able to warp while using squad tools.

    SMALL ADDITIONS:
    - Added a new formation walk tool to the squads system: Drawable formation lines. These allow the commander of a squad to determine the exact size of the formation using a special wand.
    - Mixing different unit types in the same squad is no longer allowed.
    - Added new soldier type: Archer.
    - Using the regular squad formation walk tool after the line formation tool will make it remember the previous formation.
    - Sidebar kingdom name font size has been significantly reduced. There should no longer be massive sidebars that take up half of your screen.
    - Significantly improved error-logging for core functions. If something goes wrong, the game should now spell out *exactly* what's wrong (at the cost of being slightly more obnoxious).
    - Did a ground-up re-write of the sidebar code (which was still a relic of Alpha 2). It now loads new data almost instantly. Additionally, I've introduced a new sub-command to the sidebar command - '/sidebar mode <mode>' - which allows you to cycle through different "pages" of the sidebar, which now display data on different grouped aspects of your kingdom (e.g. 'Default' Data, Duchy Data, Scenario-specific data).
    - Rewrote the Kingdom-Dynmap integration to add a whole load of new features like proper coloring for each kingdom's territory and support for duchies. Additionally, this fixed a lot of longstanding bugs to do with incorrect usages of Dynmap's API.

    LARGE ADDITIONS:
    - Miner NPCs have been reworked. They now make use of world-wide heat maps for different resources that mimic real life patterns of resource presence.
        * I.e. some regions will be really rich in certain resources while really poor in others, further encouraging trade between kingdoms.
    - Kingdoms can now send each other mail via the /letter command directly to each others' mailboxes.
    - Introduced the first version of the Duchies mechanic which allows kingdoms to segment their territory into duchies that can then be ruled by different members within that kingdom designated by its leader as dukes.
        * Duchies will be subject to different territory permissions within their kingdoms that allow only their duke and the king to break blocks/interact with the world within them.
        * Duchy banks will also be separate from the overall kingdom bank (which will now be largely reliant on a tax levvied on duchies)
    - Added war justification mechanics. You can't just go and kill random kingdoms' squads now.
        + Alongside this, I also added a proper occupation system so that players can keep track of how much territory they've stolen off other kingdoms during wars.
    

Scenario 1.0.0 :: 2-JUL-2024 -> 01-AUG-2024;
__________________________________________
    SMALL ADDITIONS:
    - Slowed crop growth to 35% of vanilla crop growth rate.

    LARGE ADDITIONS:
    - Added food-population mechanics + Food fullfillment and information window via /food.
    - Introduced river trade tacker mechanic which scales the amount of trade that can be conducted with Fyndalin based on how open the Vexell river is to trade.
    - Introduced trade mechanic which allows both kingdoms to trade with (the off-map) Fyndalin Empire at relatively fixed prices.
    - Added a kingdom-specific mechanic just for Jalerad which automatically runs an election for it whenever no king is on the throne for longer than an in-game week.


Known Bugs;
__________________________________________
    - Squad NPCs may start to fight each other - on occasion - after exiting an engagement with another squad. I'm still not sure what triggers the behaviour but I'm looking into it.


Additional Notes;
__________________________________________
    - I have been looking back through last year's log files, trying to find a root cause for the permissions issues that have always plagued the server (i.e. players logging in the wrong gamemode, weird bugs caused by not being able to access certain commands etc.). Turns out it wasn't an issue with Kingdoms, but with the perms plugin Kingdoms has always used: GroupManager. As it seems, GM doesn't actually have multi-world support and kept on overwriting its own values each time a player joined a world other than KingdomsCurrent (usually me oops). So Kingdoms now supports LuckPerms as its default permissions plugin.
