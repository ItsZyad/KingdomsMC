  - Dear Mother,<n>Thank you again for the parcel of fruits. I asked the rider to send my thanks when I received them, but I don't suspect delivery of my reply was a priority for
  - him.<n>Unfortunately, I don't believe we'll be able to exchange any more bulky goods. Fyndalin's army has doubled in size over the last week, with more reinforcements arriving from nearby camps.
  - Smuggling is getting harder and harder, and the riders are charging more and more per kilogram of goods.<n>Enclosed you'll find something a little less conspicuous - a sample of Skylik's
  - home-distilled kirsch. Maybe you have more of a pallet for it than me. Mother, I can't contain my fears any further.<n>With every passing day I long more and more for the old country - regretting
  - the decisions that led me to immigrating to this city. It all seemed so safe, such an easy decision - whether it was a false sense of security from the city's defenses, or just the obscurity of the
  - city's location. Hard to say in hindsight.<n>Whatever happens, happens. Perhaps this will all boil over, and they will come to an agreement. Or perhaps the siege will come to a boiling point and end in

  - watch.<n><n>I am enclosing this letter with a cavalryman of the city militia who is defecting. I don't feel good about it, but there's a reason why I feel such an
  - urgency to send you another letter.<n><n>I am joining the fight.<n><n>At the time of writing, I am waiting for the armourer to fit me with a

  - Dear Mother,<n><n>I recommend that you stop sending food. The cured pork that you sent was stolen. The city is down to half rations, and each of us are getting half
  - a loaf of bread and four ounces of fish per day.<n><n>I'm reminded of the stories of the heroes of old, the ones who held out for forty days and nights in the face
  - of overwhelming odds. In this difficult time, we have very little hope to cling to. But signs of hope remain on the horizon. The city guard is still successfully fending off Fyndalin's army from the wall
  - - and they have yet to attempt an actual assault on the city. This gives me hope that the siege will end without bloodshed.<n><n>Difficult times are a part of history.
  - Perhaps this war was inevitable. But I am glad that it come to my time rather than the time of my children.<n><n>Skylik and Karr are well. They look forward to seeing
  - you after all of this is over. We've been sharing our rations and working on recipes that only require bread and fish - I think their spirits are still high.<n><n>With
