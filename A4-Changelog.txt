Bug Fixes / Performance Upgrades:
    - [Technical] Folded all flags that prevent the player from chatting (for inputting values and such) into a single flag (noChat) to improve stability.
        - Players should no longer randomly lose the ability to chat after using certain influence features.
    - [Technical] Server now runs PaperMC 1.19.x - noticable performance increases.
    - [Technical] Guard pathfinding now runs on a separate thread to improve server performance while guards are moving.
    - [Technical] Sidebar only runs for online players, greatly improving command performance.
    - Adjusted mason/militia item order algorithm to favour more requests.
    - Prevented general thorvald from starting two dialogues with you at the same time.
    - Fixed material transfer chest issue where the sign wouldn't generate depending on which chest side you place it on.
    - Adjusted some kingdom text colors.
    - Fixed bug which allowed players to sit on chairs through walls
    - Fixed a bug where under certain circustances the server join message would read 'null'
        - Warping is significantly snappier. Lag is essentially eliminated however chunk loading may still take ~2-3 seconds;
        - General FPS increase in the ballpark of 15-25%.
        - Average script reload times are about 10% faster.
    - Fixed guards attacking own kingdom members bug (I hope...).
    - Fixed uncommon bug which crashes the server when guards attempt to pathfind.
    - Fixed a bug which prevented players from claiming core chunks.
    - Fixed a bug which caused the player to "discover" an area when sitting down on stairs.
    - Fixed certain mechanics borking out because I misspelt the word 'kingdoms' in the code;
        - Yes, I am very smart.
