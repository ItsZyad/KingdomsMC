            - <dataget ...>
            - <datastore ...>
            - <give ...>
            - <state ...>
            - and more.
        - Some supplementary in-schema configurations;
            - talkSpeed,
            - blockingInteraction,
            - debug,

Known bugs (Should be patched soon:tm:):
    - Under some circumstances squad orders can just stop working randomly. This can be temporarily remedied by exiting squad orders and re-entering;
        - Likely caused by a misreferenced variable somewhere-- so should be an easy fix when I find it.
