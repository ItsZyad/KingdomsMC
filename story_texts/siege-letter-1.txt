Dear Mother,

Thank you again for the parcel of fruits. I asked the rider to send my thanks when I received them, but I don’t suspect delivery of my reply was a priority for him.

Unfortunately, I don’t believe we’ll be able to exchange any more bulky goods. Fyndalin’s army has doubled in size over the last week, with more reinforcements arriving from nearby camps. Smuggling is getting harder and harder, and the riders are charging more and more per kilogram of goods. 

Enclosed you’ll find something a little bit less conspicuous; a sample of Skylik’s home-distilled kirsch. Maybe you have more of a pallet for it than me. Mother, I can’t contain my fears any further.

With every passing day I long more and more for the old country; regretting the decisions that led me to immigrating to this city. It all seemed so safe, such an easy decision; whether it was a false sense of security from the city’s defenses, or just the obscurity of the city’s location. Hard to say in hindsight.

Whatever happens, happens. Perhaps this will all boil over and they will come to an agreement. Or perhaps the siege will come to a boiling point and end in blood. Whatever happens, I will look after Skylik and Karr. I promise.

Yours truly,
Claud
