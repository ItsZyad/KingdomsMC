Captain’s Log — [DAY 1]


Beast’s Maw departed port this morning as scheduled with 119 crew. She is accompanied by freighters Pegasus, Meadowfield, and cruiser Kostalda. Our departure is smooth and we carry sufficient rations for a 120-day journey. 


I think the only thing I fear right now is my own stamina. A year is a long time. I’m going to be evaluated for every single hour of every single day. Let’s just hope we can handle it.


[DAY 2]


Lieutenant-Commander Hermandor of Kostalda introduced himself to me today. He’s to be my deputy governor when we arrive.


He’s a young man for an officer of his status, no doubt well educated. He presented himself as a well-spoken, competent helmsman and cannoneer who seems to command respect from his crew. He has an air of unconfidence about him, though; I can smell that from a mile away. I’m not a navy man, but if he’s to earn my respect he’ll have to prove his skills in navigation.
