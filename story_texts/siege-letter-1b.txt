Dear Mother,


I recommend that you stop sending food. The cured pork that you sent was stolen. The city is down to half rations, and each of us are getting half a loaf of bread and four ounces of fish per day.


I’m reminded of the stories of the heroes of old, the ones who held out for forty days and nights in the face of overwhelming odds. In this difficult time, we have very little hope to cling to. But signs of hope remain on the horizon. The city guard is still successfully fending off Fyndalin’s army from the wall; and they have yet to attempt an actual assault on the city. This gives me hope that the siege will end without bloodshed.


Difficult times are a part of history. Perhaps this war was inevitable. But I am glad that it came in my time rather than the time of my children.


Skylik and Karr are well. They look forward to seeing you after all of this is over. We’ve been sharing our rations and working on recipes that only require bread and fish; I think their spirits are still high.


With love,


Claud
