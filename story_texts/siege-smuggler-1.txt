Dear Hoggar,

I am excited to report that our weekly sales have once again exceeded expectations. As the situation grows more dire in the city, the poor are becoming more and more desperate for diversions from the siege.

Please forward the following order to our suppliers:
• 400 oz glowstone dust
• 50 slime balls
• 100 oz sugar
• 50 oz rotten flesh

This should get us through to the next week. I’m being conservative with the rotten flesh orders, as I’ve found they go bad quite quickly.

I must say, Hoggar, this siege is perhaps the best thing that’s ever happened to the Elytra Company. Our industry was being overrun, and, though I hesitate to share this with you, I was considering ceasing our operations only a few months ago.

We inside the city all wish you the best. Continue to use our previously-scouted entrance to the city.

Sincerely,
Cynthius
