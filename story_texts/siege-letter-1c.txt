Mother,


The inevitable, it seems, has happened. The battle has started.


The enemy has breached the first gate. They are currently boxed into the small area between the outer wall and the main part of the city, but I’m told that the city guard is out of arrows. All that they can do is watch.


I am enclosing this letter with a cavalryman of the city militia who is defecting. I don’t feel good about it, but there’s a reason why I feel such an urgency to send you another letter.


I am joining the fight.


At the time of writing, I am waiting for the armourer to fit me with a breastplate and helmet. As I promised, I will take care of Skylik and Karr. I wish you the best. I hope to see you again.


Claud
