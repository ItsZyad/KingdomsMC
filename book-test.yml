  Editor's Note:
  -------------------
  In this turbulent era which we find ourselves in, witnessing the truth being laid out infront of us, as clear as day, is not a commonality. Usually, some assumptions have to be made, some sources have to be stretched, and some
- |-
  facts simply do not allow themselves to be found.

  Last week was an exception, however. An anonymous source, identifying themselves as a former government official delivered a document produced by the mandate council about 10 years ago, when
- |-
  reconstruction first began.

  This series of memos, records, and deliberations between the occupation forces paints a grim picture showing a Fyndalin that they wish to build. One that would serve their odious needs and insaitable appetite for power.
- This week's article will be slightly different from our usual format. Instead of
  providing commentary, or the viewpoints of our journalists and editors. We will
  instead be quoting some of the most salient (and detestable) paragraphs from this
  dossier.
- There will be a number of issues in a similar vain to this, as we lay out the vast
  contents of this dossier, and explore some of the shady and villanous dealings that
  our city has unfortunately become the subject of.
- "I hope to return our issues to their regular format by next month.\n\nThank you\
  \ all for your continued support of free and unrestricted journalism.\n\nChief Editor,\
  \ FFT,\nPavlus Kielnbacker. \n"

            ISSUE I:

       THE MATTER OF               MATERIAL

  From page 1;
  -------------------
  "The information presented in this document is highly sensitive and should only be viewed with the approval of the council president. Any unauthorized viewing may result in 10+ years prison time at the special court's discretion"
- |-
  From page 8: An excerpt from the master plan;
  -------------------
  "Fyndalin is an innately aggressive and militarist society. For such sentiment to be contained, there must be a complete overhaul of Fyndalin's culture, governance, and design. All facets of life must be re-
- |-
  created in order to promote peace and acceptance of other cultures."

  [...]

  "Every effort must be made to ensure Fyndalin's seamless integration into continental politics. With or without local approval."
- |-
  From page 14: Excerpt from master plan - chapter on jurisdiction;
  -------------------
  "Fyndalin's reconstruction will be split into four zones equivalent in size to the assessed capability of each coalition kingdom [See page 171 on assessed strength and respon-
- |-
  -sibility of coalition members]."

  "Only zone two (consisting of Port Liberty and district one) shall have the authorization to use stone and brick in general construction."
- |-
  From page 21: Excerpt from master plan - subsection on building material regulations;
  -------------------
  "As mentioned prior, only zone two shall have authorization to use stone and brick in general construction in select locations. All other sites around the city must have foundations built of
- |-
  regulation-strength wood and composite materials"

  [...]

  "Crews are required to alert the city's permanent peacekeeping garrison of any buildings with existing stone foundations so that they can be ear-
- -marked for demolition. [...] Free-act exemptions, issued by the special  occupation
  court of Fyndalin can be used by demolition officers to allow immediate approval
  of site removal requests without oversight."
- |-
  From page 86: A letter sent from the mandate council president to the commanding officer in charge of city garrisons;
  -------------------
  Goodday Friedrick,

  I hope this letter finds you well. And I trust that the reconstruction process is going
- |-
  swimingly.

  I just wanted to update you on the status of master-planning - while it is almost wrapped up - there are a couple complications.

  Yesterday, the Musepl representative issued an ammendment to the
- |-
  revised building code that limited material use to only wood-based products in zones 3 & 4.

  The declared reasoning was to cut down on cost overheads considering the extent of the damage in those sectors.
- |-
  However, I was highly skeptical and pressed him for an actual response, later that day, and he admitted that the reasons were military/strategic in nature but was not at liberty to discuss it further.

  I have a bad feeling that reconstruction focuses are deviating
- "catasrophically.\n\nWhen you inevitably recieve the order to enforce the new ammendment,\
  \ try to put it off as much as possible while I try to dig further. Something tells\
  \ me that bigger forces are at play...\n\nBest Regards,\n-Janek Halfordson "
